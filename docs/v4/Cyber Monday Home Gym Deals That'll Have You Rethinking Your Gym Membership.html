Stationary Bikes</h2><div><p>If you're a cycling enthusiast but lack the space or budget for a full-sized exercise bike, a stationary bike is the ideal solution.

<p>Stationary bikes are a popular choice for indoor exercise because they provide a low-impact cardiovascular workout that is easy on the joints. They also allow you to exercise in the comfort of your own home, regardless of the weather outside. With a stationary bike, you can pedal away while watching TV, listening to music, or even reading a book.</p>
<p>When choosing a stationary bike, there are a few things to consider. First, decide on your budget and the features you want. Do you want a basic model that simply allows you to pedal, or do you want a high-tech option with advanced features such as Bluetooth connectivity and built-in workout plans?</p>
<p>Next, consider the type of resistance you want. There are two main types of resistance: magnetic and direct-contact. Magnetic resistance is quieter and requires less maintenance, while direct-contact resistance provides a more realistic road-like feel.</p>
<p>Finally, think about the size of the bike and the space you have available. Some stationary bikes are compact and foldable, making them ideal for small apartments or homes with limited space.</p></div><img src='https://source.unsplash.com/600x400/?stationary-bike' /> <br><h2>5.
