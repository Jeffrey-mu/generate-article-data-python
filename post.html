<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Leukemia is cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue such as the bone marrow or lymphatic system. White blood cells
  are produced by blood-forming tissue, and these cells help fight off infections in the body. Leukemia can impede the
  production of white blood cells, leaving the body prone to infections. It can also cause a buildup of abnormal white
  blood cells known as leukemia cells. The earlier the leukemia is diagnosed, the better the prognosis for patients.
  However, the symptoms of leukemia often vary widely depending on the specific type and individual, so it's important
  to be aware of the most common symptoms of this disease so you can seek medical attention if necessary.</p>
<h2>Fatigue and Weakness</h2>
<p>A lack of energy and general malaise are common symptoms of leukemia. Patients with leukemia may feel extremely weak
  or tired and may have trouble completing everyday tasks or normal activities. These symptoms can persist even after
  getting enough rest, so if you feel unusually tired or weak, it's important to speak to your doctor about the
  possibility of leukemia.</p>
<h2>Unexplained Bruising or Bleeding</h2>
<p>Leukemia can hinder the body's ability to produce enough clotting cells known as platelets, which can lead to
  spontaneous bruising and bleeding. Patients may develop red or purple spots on the skin, known as petechiae, which
  occur when there is bleeding under the skin.</p>
<h2>Recurrent Infections</h2>
<p>Leukemia can significantly compromise the immune system's function, making patients more susceptible to various
  infections such as fever, cough, flu, chills, and sweating at night. Patients with leukemia may develop recurrent
  infections that last longer than usual, and they may have trouble fighting off these infections even with antibiotic
  treatment.</p>
<h2>Bone Pain</h2>
<p>Leukemia can also cause the bone marrow to produce an excessive number of white blood cells, leading to bone pain.
  This pain is usually felt in the legs and hips and can be severe enough to make movement difficult. If you experience
  persistent pain in the bones and joints, it's important to consult your doctor immediately since it could be a sign of
  leukemia.</p>
<h2>Abdominal Pain and Swelling</h2>
<p>In some cases, leukemia can cause an enlarged spleen, which can lead to abdominal pain and swelling. Patients may
  also experience a loss of appetite and nausea, and they may feel full much more quickly than usual even after eating a
  small amount of food. If you notice pain or swelling in your abdomen or have recently lost your appetite or are
  constantly nauseous, it's important to speak to your doctor to explore the possibility of leukemia.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Leukemia is a serious condition that can have severe consequences if it goes undiagnosed and untreated. It's
  important to be aware of the most common symptoms of leukemia so you can seek medical attention if necessary. The
  symptoms may vary from patient to patient, so it's important to listen to your body and reach out to your doctor as
  soon as possible if you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
